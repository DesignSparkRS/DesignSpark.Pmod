   :alt: PmodAD1

The Digilent Pmod AD1 (Revision G) is a two channel 12-bit analog-to-digital converter that features Analog Devices' AD7476A. With a sampling rate of up to 1 million samples per second, this Pmod™ is capable of excelling in even the most demanding audio applications. 

Features:

* Two channel 12-bit analog-to-digital converter
* Simultaneous A/D conversion at up to one MSa per channel
* Two 2-pole Sallen-Key anti-alias filters
* Small PCB size for flexible designs 0.95 in × 0.8 in (2.4 cm × 2.0 cm)
* 6-pin Pmod port with GPIO interface

.. note::
    Only a single channel (A1) is supported at present due to the
    way that SPI is configured.
